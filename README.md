# node1
First Node.JS project using simple API

This Node.JS project is based on a simple selection of products where product information is served dynamic via a simple API. 

This project helped me to learn and better understand:
1) What Node actually is
2) Running JavaScript outside the broswer
3) Using modules
4) Reading and writing files
5) The Blocking and non-blocking nature of Node.JS (Async vs sync)
6) Reading and writing files asynchronously
7) Creating a simple web server
8) Routing
9) Building a simple API
10) HTML Templating - building and filling
11) Parsing variables from URL's

This project is not fully functional as the shopping cart currently has no functionality. The code has been set up and organized to limit the server request to as few as possible. 

A general walk through of the project with notes/observations is as below:
